    			<p>" The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth."</p>
    			<p><code>-John F. Kennedy</code></p>
    			<p>Most of us will agree that an educated person gets better opportunities in life. It is easier for him to become successful 
    			and realize his dreams as compared to someone who is uneducated. </p>
    			<p>ROOH primarily focuses on education for those who are mentally endowed but economically poor. These are some of children
    			to whom we sponsors.</p>
